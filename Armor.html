			<h5>light armor</h5>
			<p>light armor is simple, when wearing light armor you take the variable listed above as well as your dex modifier to determine your AC, you have a slight chance at disadvantage with stealth (check table above) but you should be fine, this is the basic armor which holds up fairly well, useful for more manuvering defenses and tight spots. this type of armor only takes 1 minute to put on and 1 minute to take off</p>
			<h5>medium armor</h5>
			<p>made from good materials this armor doesn't restrict movement too much being a nice inbetween for most play styles. this armor might have disadvantage on stealth but the odds are only slightly higher than light armor, a nice go between for tanks and swift movers this is a good use armor which can sometimes top heavy armor in defense ability. this armor takes 5 minutes to put on and 1 minute to take off</p>

			<h5>heavy armor</h5>
			<p>heavy armor is the best of the best with this game, while this armor will not let you add your dex modifier to your Ac and always gives you disadvantage in stealth it makes up for the annoyance with sheer level of durability. this armor typacly stands well and is useful for tanks able to hold there own. the downside to this armor is the fact it normally requires a specific strength score, consult the chart above for refrance. this armor takes 10 minutes to put on and 5 minutes to take off</p>
			<h5>sheild</h5>
			<p>a sheild is a standerd defensive tool, this item adds a +2 on your AC at the expense of one hand, some sheilds can be worn on your arm or have some effects to which you should discuss it with your DM. sheilds are by far the easiest item to equipt, using 1 action or about 6 seconds to put on and the same time to put away</p>
